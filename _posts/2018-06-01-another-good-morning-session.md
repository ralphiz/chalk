This session felt really good. Johnny and I went straight to the back wall (since it was the newest set) and warmed up a bit before hopping on some of the harder routes.

I tried a yellow v4 that had a big move a little bit after the lip. Johnny and I noticed there were a lot of big moves for this set. I wasn't able to do the yellow v4 the whole way through but I did practice both halves of it. I'll piece it together another day.

I was able to finish a white v5 with some tips from Johnny. There's a move that I was having trouble with but I was able to stick it after taking Johnny's advice. His suggestions were:
- Have my foot one hold lower; I kind of had to pogo so having my foot lower would have me swing less outward
- Sink lower; sinking lower and going straight up helped me get to the next hold rather than moving away from it

After I got the move that I was stuck on, I actually went up using the wrong hand and I had to go back one hold and switch. Luckily, I had the endurance to stay on and I finished the route. Looking forward to trying this white v5 again to practice the moves.

I was able to do the yellow v5 that I had done on Wednesday. While I was doing the route, I had a minor brain fart on how I did it. I'll be repeating this climb again for sure.

Overall, it was a really fun morning session. Denise climbed a bit too - she tried a v3 and v4 on the overhang. I'm so proud of how far she's gone in her recovery, it was so heartbreaking when she injured herself but I know she is determined to get back to 100 percent.

Looking forward to having Von's tonight with friends! SNRK.
