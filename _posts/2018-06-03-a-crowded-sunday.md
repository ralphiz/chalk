When we got to the gym, it was super crowded and it was very hot. I did some deadlifting since the climbing areas were super packed. After that I met up with Justin and Diana in the front wall and started to warm up.

After warming up I tried out the white v6. The first few moves were tough during the initial try because I didn't really look at the route before getting on it. After trying it 2-3 times I started to piece it together. I ended up trying it from the middle and I got up to the part where it's a pretty big bump with my right hand and it felt that I could get it but I ended up jumping down and saving my energy for the other climbs in the back wall. I would definitely try the white v6 again.

Ended up seeing Rolando and found out that he sets at 'The Peak' in Fremont. I haven't been to that climbing gym ever since it was 'City Beach' - I'd definitely want to check it out when I can.

There was a guy (we'll call him `green shirt`) trying out the pinchy black v8 on the right cheek and two other newer climbers trying a v2/v3 (we'll call them `clymber 1` and `clymber 2`) relatively close to `green shirt`. The guy, `clymber 1`, was wearing rental shoes and was on the wall with his friend `clymber 2` close by trying to coach him on what to do (but not really paying attention to other climbers obviously). At the same time `green shirt` was on his climb, the black v8.

>I was looking in their direction because I wanted to practice the middle portion of the white v6, which was in the way of the black v8, so I had to wait my turn. I see `clymber 1` fall from his route onto the mat and he's laying there for a few seconds. While `clymber 1` is just laying there, `clymber 2` is just talking to him and not telling him to get up; `green shirt` ends up falling off the black v8 literally inches away from falling feet first on `clymber 1`'s face.

> `Green shirt` ended up apologizing saying, "oh, sorry I didn't see you there," but in reality, `clymber 1` shouldn't have been laying there for that long in the first place. He could've gotten hurt pretty badly.
**END side story**

After it got a bit cooler, we ended up going to the back wall. I tried the purple v7 a few times and the white v5 from Friday. Overall it was a good session but damn that heat was harsh. Nick and Debbie showed up a bit late but at least we got to see them. Ended up going home before going to Jessica's backyard comedy event; that was super fun! After that, we ended up getting dinner at Mendicino Farms and dessert at Tin Pot Creamery.
