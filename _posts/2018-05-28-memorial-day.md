Nise and I arrived at the gym around 10AM(?) - I forget because I'm typing this up a few days after. I took pre-workout that morning since I was planning on climbing hard. I did some stretching before climbing and it definitely helped me get loose and climb longer.

A lot of people were at the gym including Diana, Kristine, Justin, Nick, Jane, Krystelle, Gus, and Juvy. We also saw a bunch of other familiar faces. Overall it was a very fun session hanging out and climbing.

After warming up, I tried working on a black v6 in the front, by the entrance. The starting moves has a toe hook which was pretty fun to try. When talking to Nick about how he did it, he said that he was able to keep his toe on up until the part where I fall (since he is a bit taller). Looking forward to trying it again in the coming weeks.

I also worked on blue v6 and purple v7 in the back on the overhang wall. Never thought I would be working on a v7 but at the same time, I have gotten stronger and more confident in my abilities.

I've got the moves down for the blue v6 up until the weird undercling to the move to the next incut crimp. I tried it a few times and was able to hit it. I'm still having a bit of trouble with that move but I think I can make it a bit easier. After looking at the route through pictures and videos, I think maybe a mantle would work? Gonna try that next time I can.

As for the purple v7, the starting moves are really fun to do. It seems very shoulder-intensive because the next two days I started feeling it; more on that later. The move that everyone is stuck on is the part getting from a good left hand with a pretty bad right hand up passed the lip. The way I've been trying it is going up left with a left heel hook. I'm really close to sticking it, hopefully I can next time around.
