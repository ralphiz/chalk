Denise and I didn't take any pre-workout and I just felt so tired during this gym session. I ended up just doing 33 minutes on the elliptical and then climbed. I think Denise mainly did her physical therapy and some yoga.

I warmed up at the back left wall then moved to the overhang wall after. I did a few of the v3's and v4's that have pretty big moves but I still do them because it's fun. Nick was also at the gym and ended up meeting up with me at the back wall after he lifted. We tried the purple v7 a few times but still no luck. After that we moved to the front wall so he could work on the blue v7 and I could work on that white v6 I tried.

Nick tried the blue v7 a few times but I think he was super tired from trying it with Debbie yesterday. I tried the white v6 two times but I was really sore and did not get as far as I did. Decided to call it a day and try it again later in the week. Denise and I went to Whole Foods before heading home to get a few groceries. :)
