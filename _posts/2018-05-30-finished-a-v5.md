We arrived at the gym (PGSV) at around 6:40AM - Denise did her stretches and I did core: situps, leg lifts, russian twists and figure eights. I'm thinking of adding one or two more core exercises but I'm not sure yet. For now, these four exercises will do for core.

After doing core, I decided to do some climbing, so I warmed up in the fron wall. After that, I went to check the back wall and I was happy to see that they filled the rest of the overhang wall.

I did a few more warm up routes in the back before hopping on some harder routes. I did one of the new v3's and I definitely felt good to try some of the harder stuff. I debated on trying the blue v6 and purple v7 from two days ago. However, since there were a lot of new routes, I decided to start trying some of them.

I ended up trying a yellow v5, next to another v5 that I tried on Monday. The first time trying it felt good but I didn't know where to put my feet after the first few holds. I fell off and rested and tried it again a second time after a few minutes. Fell off at about the same spot and decided to just rest and stare at it and figure out what I can do with my feet.

As I stared at it, I realized that I could probably try and get my heel up to where I match my hands, I would just have to move my left hand to do so. Doing so would enable me to reach up with my left and progress through the rest of the route. I gave it a try and to my surprised I was able to finish the route. I will definitely be doing this route again to hone the moves.

After climbing, I did some deadlifts. I didn't go too heavy because my shoulder was still kind of sore from Monday.

Overall a great morning at the gym!
